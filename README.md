# NYSE-100 Regression Project

## Project Overview

In this project both financial and macroeconomic indicators are used to forecast the NYSE-100 and prediction performance of the indicators including lagged values of NYSE-100 will be analyzed. Four different machine
learning methods are applied. The data used in the project has nonlinear dynamics so models' coping abilities against the nonlinear features are taken into consideration.

## Sections of the Project

1-  Defining the problem        
2-  Data            
3-  Evaluation of the model               
4-  Features

Detailed information including label and features, primary analysis, data transformations, technique used in forecasting, machine learning models and feature engineering are detailed in the projected.
